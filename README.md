messaging for a school on a website that hasn't been blocked by the admin...yet


### Note:
Hello, Emma! This is Daniel. I wrote this in Node.js-a native ECMAScript runtime for the server. To make sure this app can run, be sure you have installed Node.js and npm, a package manager for Node, kind of like Ruby Gems (it's bundled with Node). After pulling my changes (no doubt you will), run `npm i` inside of this directory to install all of the dependencies such as `express` and `socket.io`. Then, just run `npm start` to run the app and `npm test` to debug. To push this onto Heroku, just run `heroku git:remote -a <appname>`.
